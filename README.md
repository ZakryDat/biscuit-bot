# Biscuitbot

A fun, but unpolished and unfinished hack developing an alexa voice "skill"
Created using the AWS developer console, lambda functions and a Dynamo database. Hits up OpenAI's Gpt3 for AI poem-writing.

Tagline: "The final authority on all things biscuit-based."

Features: Users can be added to a database, can query the database, can find out other users'
favourite biscuits, can work out whose turn it is to buy biscuits and can ask for the bot to write a poem about a favourite biscuit. Additionally, Biscuitbot will scold anyone who dares mention jaffa cakes.
